#Goals and Project Description

The goal of this data project is to visualize data on herbivores collected by camera traps in Botswana. The data was captured from 2/2021 through 8/2021, taking pictures and identifying the species of the animal in the photo. We merged two data sets: one on information about the camera traps themselves, such as longitude, latitude, and distance to roads or villages; and one with data on the photos taken over these months. Together, we can look at the quantity and diversity of species over time and space. We filtered the data to only herbivores, and looked at the relationship between time of day and species distribution, survey location and species diversity, and the distance to cattle posts (source of water) with cows as well as with wild species. Water is a vital resource to these animals in this dry climate, so there is often tension between humans trying to get their livestock water and wild animals looking to utilize the same resource. We predict that domestic animals will co-occur with humans, as humans are guiding their livestock and are more active during the day.
